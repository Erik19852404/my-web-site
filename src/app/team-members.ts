    full_story: 'I was born in 1985 in Kyrgizstan. I finished Bishkek Humanities University and got a degree of Specialist(bachelor) of sociology. In our country sociology was not very popular and I hadn\'t opportunity to make a good career. So, more then 7 years I worked in various casinos, because of high salary. But it wasn\'t interesting to me, I always wanted to take part in software development. And ones I got a chance to become a participant of online game production with the wonderful "Allods Team". It was the first step in a software tester career. Now I\'m professional tester with different useful skills. My level of english is intermadiate. I can write and read documentation without any problem, but I hadn\'t enough speaking practice.',
