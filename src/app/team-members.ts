    full_story: 'I was born in 1985 in Kyrgizstan. I finished Bishkek Humanities University and got a degree of Specialist(bachelor) of sociology. In our country sociology was not very popular and didn\'t give good prospect for career. So, more then 7 years I worked in casino, because of high salary. But it wasn\'t interesting to me, I always wanted to take part in software development. And one nice day I got a chance to become participant of online game production with wonderful "Allods Team". It was my first step like a software tester. Now I\'m professional tester with different useful skills. My english is not very good. I can write and read documentation without any problem, but I hadn\'t enough speaking practice, so my verbal skills isn\'t very good.',
